# CSE182 - Database Management Systems
 
Took this course per requirement for my Bioinformatics BSc degree, was an exteremely valuable course as I learned how to apply application programming to connect pgSQL to Java programming language, a skill I use extensively in bioinformatics research. The course was a thorough introduction of database ACID properites, foundations of SQL programming, improtant database theory like functional dependencies, seeing if database schemas are in 3NF or BCNF or neither, and OLAP.
